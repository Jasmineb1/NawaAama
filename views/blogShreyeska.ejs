                  <h3>Take a prenatal supplement every day.</h3>
                  <p>
                    Everyone needs to take prenatal supplements (also called prenatal vitamins) during pregnancy. Talk with your doctor or nurse about a prenatal vitamin that’s right for you.And make sure you get enough of these key nutrients:</p>
                    <ul id="unlisted">
                        <li>
                            Folic acid helps prevent some birth defects of the brain and spine. Choose a prenatal supplement that has 400 to 800 mcg of folic acid. Learn more about getting enough folic acid.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Iron helps your baby develop, and many women don’t get enough iron during pregnancy. Ask your doctor if you need a prenatal supplement with iron. Learn more about ironThis link is external to health.gov..
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Iodine is important for your baby’s brain. If you use salt at home, make sure it’s iodized salt (salt with added iodine). Prenatal supplements may not have iodine — ask your doctor whether you need an iodine supplement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Choline is also important for your baby’s brain. Choose foods with choline — like low-fat and fat-free dairy, eggs, lean meats, seafood, beans, and lentils. It’s also important to note that many prenatal supplements don’t have choline. If you think you might not be getting enough choline, talk to your doctor.

          <h2>Get the right amount of calories for you.</h2>
        <h4>How many calories you need will change throughout your pregnancy. Most women with a healthy pre-pregnancy weight have the following calorie needs:</h4>
        <ul id="unlisted">
          <li>First trimester (first 12 weeks) — no extra calories</li>
      <li>Second trimester (13 to 26 weeks) — about 340 extra calories a day</li>
      <li>Last trimester (after 26 weeks) — about 450 extra calories a day</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Weight gain is a natural part of pregnancy. How much weight is healthy to gain — and the number of extra calories you’ll need — depends on many things, including how much you weighed before pregnancy. Ask your doctor or midwife how many calories you need and how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy.</p>

          <h3>Take a prenatal supplement every day.</h3>
          <p>
            Everyone needs to take prenatal supplements (also called prenatal vitamins) during pregnancy. Talk with your doctor or nurse about a prenatal vitamin that’s right for you.And make sure you get enough of these key nutrients:</p>
            <ul id="unlisted">
                <li>
                    Folic acid helps prevent some birth defects of the brain and spine. Choose a prenatal supplement that has 400 to 800 mcg of folic acid. Learn more about getting enough folic acid.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Iron helps your baby develop, and many women don’t get enough iron during pregnancy. Ask your doctor if you need a prenatal supplement with iron. Learn more about ironThis link is external to health.gov..
                </li>
                <li>
                    Iodine is important for your baby’s brain. If you use salt at home, make sure it’s iodized salt (salt with added iodine). Prenatal supplements may not have iodine — ask your doctor whether you need an iodine supplement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Choline is also important for your baby’s brain. Choose foods with choline — like low-fat and fat-free dairy, eggs, lean meats, seafood, beans, and lentils. It’s also important to note that many prenatal supplements don’t have choline. If you think you might not be getting enough choline, talk to your doctor.
